## Major Features
1. Users can delete listings they created.
2. Users can delete bookings they made.
3. Logged in users can open their mail client with prefilled subject and target receiver by clicking a 'Send email to host' button in the listing detail page. So that they can send an email to the host to consult about the listing.
4. Google Map API is used in the single listing page. Once the user use real address, the exact location on the map will be shown in the single listing page. (Spent huge amount of time working this this feature, especially on dealing with the google map api keep reloading issue when using a useState to store the lat and lng. Plsssssssssssss give some generous mark)
